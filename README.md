Text-to-Speech Voice Assistant                                                                                                                                                                             Developed a Python-based text-to-speech voice assistant using the pyttsx3 library, capable of continuously converting user-provided text into spoken audio output. This application is ideal for accessibility solutions, enhancing user interaction by allowing dynamic text input and audio output in a loop.

Key Features:

Interactive Looping System: Continuously prompts for new text input, with the ability to exit on command.
Voice Selection: Configurable voice settings allowing users to choose between male and female voices.
Platform Compatibility: Compatible with Windows OS, using local speech synthesis to avoid dependency on internet connectivity.
Ease of Use: Simple, intuitive input-output flow for a user-friendly experience.
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, user interface design with command-line prompts, and application of the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality.
